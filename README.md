## Experiments Overview

### Speed Controller

The Speed Controller experiment demonstrates the use of Millennium M3 soft to create a control system that regulates the speed of a motor. This involves designing a PLC program that adjusts the motor speed based on input parameters, ensuring precise and stable operation.


### Temperature Control using PLC

This experiment involves creating a temperature control system using a PLC. The system monitors the temperature and adjusts heating or cooling devices to maintain a desired setpoint, showcasing the application of PLCs in HVAC systems and industrial processes.


### Traffic Light System

The Traffic Light System experiment uses Millennium M3 soft to simulate a traffic light control system. This includes designing a PLC program to manage the timing and sequence of traffic lights, providing a practical example of automation in traffic management.


### Water Level Controller

In this experiment, a PLC-based water level control system is created to maintain the water level in a tank. The system uses sensors to monitor the water level and activates pumps to ensure it stays within a specified range, demonstrating the application of PLCs in water management.


### Displaying Date, Time, and "Hello World" by Switch

This experiment involves programming a PLC to display the current date, time, and a "Hello World" message when a switch is activated. It demonstrates basic PLC programming techniques and the integration of external displays with control systems.
